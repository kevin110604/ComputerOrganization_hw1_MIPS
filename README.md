# MIPS
Use **MIPS instructions** to compute Fibonacci(25) and store result into register `$t0`.

## Explanation 
In my code, `i` is the for loop variable, but it's not equal to `n` in `fib()`...... See the table below.

| i | x | x | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | ... | 24 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | --- | -  |
| n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | ... | 25 |
| fib(n) | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | ... | 75025  |
